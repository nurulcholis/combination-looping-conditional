number of prime algorithm
--------------------------------

- create new variable as count 
- loop begin one to set your value
- check what your number set if modulus counter with one to your set number
- if result zero then variable count increment by one
- do it until loop end
- and then check again value of variable count
- if it equals two then display your number is prime
- else then display your number is not prime

number of prime pseudocode
---------------------------------
  STORE count
  STORE number
  FOR 1 to number
   IF number mod 1 to number is 0 THEN
     increment count with 1
   END IF 
  END FOR

  IF count equals to two THEN 
   DISPLAY number is prime
  ELSE THEN
   DISPLAY number is not prime
  END IF
